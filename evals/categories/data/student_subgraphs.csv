After these cuts, districts cannot afford to improve technology or athletics in schools. This decreases the amount of hands on learning in the classrooms as it also frustrates students, teachers, and parents. The lack of funds causes many teachers to be fired and raises the student-teacher ratio. This means that kids have less one-on-one time with students and test scores drop. The drop in test scores further lowers the scholarship opportunities for students and raises general frustration and the dropout rates of students. This creates a cycle in which further budget cuts are made each year."

The movement is supposed to ensure the safety and comfort of people but often tends to be inconvenient and may be an abuse of power. This abuse causes a loss of basic civil rights, censorship, a greater cost, and an increased corporate involvement. As a whole, this could lead to increased terrorism threats and the unhappiness of the people. An increased national/ governmental involvement is supposed to increase the safety of the people but to some people, this has merely taken away rights, made lives more complicated, and made it possible to use the people’s fear."

Increased depression will lead to drug addiction because of the need to feel some type of “high.”  Stress can also increase excessive drinking which leads to drug addiction. An active lifestyle and normal personal economic standing will decrease stress. Bad morals and bad peer influence can also directly lead to drug addiction."

Laziness directly contributes to social media. Advanced school work decreases the amount of free time, and sporting events decreases levels of laziness, which will ultimately decrease the use of social media. Publicity will directly contribute to social media because everyone wants to keep up with what is new. The availability of one click to learn about everything can also increase easy communication between people, which will increase the use of social media."

Wanting to control territories increases enemies with other countries. Also, wanting to show dominance and patriotism can increase foreign enemies. An increase of enemies in other countries increases a need for military action. Peace treaties that are made decreases foreign enemies. Foreign enemies do lead to an increase of protection from terrorism. When terrorism is so well known, it promotes violence. These factors increase the need for military action. Available jobs lead to more jobs needed for police training. Many policemen end up serving in the military which promotes military action. Two factors that do not promote military action are the saving of government money and having allies with other countries."

One of its primary drivers happens to be population density.  This is because the more people that there are in the world, the more domestic livestock will be needed to support them, and the people will create more waste overall.  As landfills fill up, the garbage will decompose, contributing to the amount of greenhouse gases that enter the atmosphere.  Methane from the domesticated livestock will also increase the level of greenhouse gases.  The more greenhouse gases there are, the more solar radiation will be retained in the atmosphere, which will melt glaciers and decrease Earth’s reflectivity.  The more reflective the Earth is, the less global warming there will be because solar radiation will bounce back into space.  As global warming continues to be an issue, more people choose to utilize renewable energy sources to slow down the process.  The renewable energy sources also will decrease the amount of fossil fuels burned.  This is very beneficial because burning more fossil fuels leads to more greenhouse gas emissions.  Deforestation and industrialization positively impact each other.  In addition, industrialization leads to more densely populated cities, the ability to make and use more renewable energy sources and contributes to the amount of oil drilled.  Because oil is a fossil fuel, it ties back to the amount of fossil fuels that are burned for energy.  All of these factors make climate change a complex problem."

This is because more unvaccinated people means that more people are susceptible to being infected with the disease.  The percent of unvaccinated person is affected by a number of factors.  The number of people with health insurance will decrease the amount of people who have not received the measles vaccine.  More people with health insurance will also decrease the amount of anti-vaccine groups.  Anti-vaccine groups cause a higher percentage of the population to not be vaccinated.  In addition, pressure by these groups on the government causes more exemptions from vaccination by state law, which further increases the amount of unvaccinated people.  On the other hand, in relation to the vaccine, more people who purchase health insurance will decrease the cost of the vaccine.  This is very beneficial as there are usually less clinics offering vaccinations when the vaccine’s cost is higher.  More clinics offering the vaccine will cause less people to not be vaccinated and will further reduce the number of countries with endemic measles.  These countries that have measles outbreaks typically lower levels of tourism.  A lot of the problem of measles spreading is due to travel so more infected people result from increased amounts of travel.  A lot of the problems can be seen to stem from the amount of natural disasters and armed conflicts in countries as well.  These more of these issues that exist, there are less clinics offering vaccination, more countries with endemic measles, less travel, and more refugee camps overall.  More refugees lead to higher population density which further facilitates the spread of measles.  Thus, the measles outbreak can be seen to be a complex issue with many feedback loops."

One of the major reasons it is a problem is due to the amount of marketing to doctors to write prescriptions.  More opioid marketing both increases the amount of prescriptions written by doctors and also decreases the number of state laws related to prescriptions due to lobbying.  More stringent regulation on prescribing opioids means less prescriptions given by doctors overall.  As more opioids are prescribed, more patients will be dependent on them and will seek more future prescriptions.  In addition, patients experiencing physical trauma will contribute to prescriptions.  Consequently, the number of dependent people will also increase marketing for the drugs.  More prescriptions will also mean both more leftover opioid pills in households and more opioid takeback locations to promote the safe disposal of extra drugs.  While more leftover pills contribute to more opioid sharing, more takeback locations will decrease the number of drugs shared.  Unfortunately, the more that opioids are shared, the more people that will be addicted to them and the more people who may overdose.  More addiction also means more illegal opioids brought into the country which will further contribute to addiction.  The two problems of overdose and illegal drug trafficking will then promote more legislation on the number of opioids that can be prescribed.  Because there are so many factors to the opioid epidemic, it can be seen as complex."

The process of this would require a lot of natural resources so this will initially have a negative impact on the environment. This will increase fuel consumption which also will negatively influence the quality of the environment. This will increase the amount of national debt because more efforts would be made to restore the environment. This debt would lead into increased government insecurity which will also increase working environment risks for all the workers and will increase mental sanity risks as well. However, the lack of safety in working environments will decrease employment rates. This has an opposite relationship with colonizing mars because this would increase employment rates which will increase the amount of taxes which can then be used to alleviate some of the national debt. Overall, if we colonize mars, this could increase future population rates."

This would first decrease the rates of communication nationally and internationally. This leads to a decrease in modernization which decreases the efficiency of completing tasks. Even though the digital interconnectedness among individuals will be lower, this stimulates face to face interactions. With lower interconnectedness rates however, the revenues of social media companies will decrease which will ultimately increase company shutdown risks. Because companies will shutdown, they will not use natural resources anymore which will increase the environment quality, then increase mental/physical health rates, which will finally increase body posture since most people have slumped backs nowadays. So, all in all, removing smartphones increases the quality of the environment."

However, the Hyperloop will increase travel efficiency, will alleviate traffic rates which will make more people more timely. This will seem favorable for consumers so travel rates will increase, which will increase electric energy consumption. Another benefit of implementing the Hyperloop is that it will increase current technological advancements but will also increase consumer safety risks. These risks will be unfavorable to consumers as this could negatively decrease health rates or even death."

The first factor considered was population which increases the effects of climate change. Population has many resulting effects such as an increase in animal migration and a negative impact on agriculture. Agriculture stems from climate change having an increase in sea level. This results in less land which in turn produces less agriculture. With less agriculture, you will receive less food and this shortage will increase the prices. An increase in price also can occur due to animal migration which results in a higher price for food. Climate change is caused by an increase in greenhouse gases. These gases have an impact on our land. One of these ways is through soil salinity which refers to how much salt is in the soil. Sea level rise also has a positive impact on soil salinity which ultimately returns to a decrease in good agriculture."

Antibiotics can only be used when one has a bacterial infection. Some uneducated people go to their doctor many times, until their doctor prescribes them antibiotics. Many times, when taking their antibiotics it correlates to them getting better, when in reality that was when the infection would have gone away on its own without the extra help of the antibiotics. The sicker one person is they are less healthy, and they tend to be using more antibiotics. The more antibiotics one uses, they are less likely to have a large number of bacteria, which is not good, because that is not only killing the toxic bacteria, but also the healthy bacteria. The more bacteria one has, a good example of it is that they are more likely to digest food properly, and thus they may suffer from correlating illness or side-effects like diarrhea. Additionally, the more antibiotics one uses, they are more likely to become resistant to antibiotics, which ends up with an increasing number of bacteria, but in this case the toxic bacteria are not being killed for common bacterial diseases that antibiotics should have been used for. Resistance to antibiotics is a huge negative, because it threatens are ability to combat illness like pneumonia and tuberculosis that could be solved with antibiotics. Resistance to antibiotics can lead to higher medical costs and increased mortality. The more likely one is using antibiotics for common bacterial diseases means that one is not using them for viral illnesses, and they are more aware of the dangers of antibiotic resistance and they tend to be healthier and they are more likely to inform others about the negatives of antibiotic resistance.

It is a problem that many people complain about, despite what stage of their life they are in. It is a give and take relationship, because in order to have a well-established family, many times one needs a career to balance the expenses of withholding a successful household. Then, comes in the balance of what is the amount of work that is too much, that takes away time from the family for whom one is working for. Examples of taking more time to train for a job include achieving a special qualification, a master’s program or taking in more experience before committing to a company. Many times, this will lead to an increase in the quality of job one receives, while taking time away from their family. An increased quality of job leads to more responsibility to work, which leads to more stress that decreases your time spent with family and one’s happiness levels. The better-quality job usually tends to correlate with a better salary, but this is all arbitrary on what aspect one defines better quality of job. If there are more leadership roles, this will typically lead to more salary, but if it simply a job that one enjoys, it will give you the salary you deserve. The greater the salary one has increases their total net worth, which is helpful when planning for the future, whether that involves a family or simply living the single life and having a fulfilled retirement. Along with a greater salary, there are a number of more enjoyable activities such as enjoying a ride first class to a European country and immersing yourself in the culture. Doing something along these lines, increases your happiness with your life, because you are not letting money dictate how one lives your life. However, many people reach a point of more happiness when they spend more time with their family and thus are more likely to meet their significant other and have children. On the other hand, children are likely to be a causer of stress that may also decrease one’s level of happiness. Overall it is hard to achieve a true balance to time managing one’s career and their family, because both are so important in this modern world that they need to take an equal amount of time, if they are both important tasks one wants to complete in their lifetime. The mean lifespan continues to increase, but people still feel that there is never enough time in the world to do everything that they would like to achieve in their life. "

There are so many approaches to raising a child from Day 1: Does one breastfeed? How many layers of clothing does the baby wear in the early days of winter? Will my child be spoiled if I hold them too much? However, much of complexity can be defined when it is time to discipline a child: a task no parent enjoys doing. If a child misbehaves, the parent typically tends to dictate the rules and punish the child, which leads to a child to cry, thinking that they are not loved or for the parents to redefine the rules so that they are clearer for the next time. When the child misbehaves and is punished or more rules are created, this leads to tension between the parent and the child, which leads to less trust in their relationship. However, when there is more trust in a relationship, both parties tend to be more honest, and the child tends to misbehave less. Many times, when a child is punished, they are more likely to misbehave, because they have already entered this cycle of trying to achieve what they wanted to act out on. When a child does not feel loved, they tend to misbehave again; they are less liking to care about their punishment, because they are playing a mind game with the parents of who can last longer in the competition of punisher and punishee. However, when the child does care about the punishment, they are more likely to behave, which leads to less crying and a better relationship, which then leads to more honesty, and less likely of misbehaving a second time. Disciplining a child is difficult, because after the first few times, the child can predict what the punishment will be and either figure out a way to avoid it. Or if their punishment is to get their phone taken away, maybe a friend gives them an old phone of theirs for the time being in order to survive until their punishment is over, meaning that they had the ability to get away with no punishment, and are more likely to misbehave again. There are many ways children are becoming more intelligent in the ways of discipling a child, because it is all so prominent on forums like Yahoo Answers and Parenting websites, where children can see how far they can really pull away with things."
