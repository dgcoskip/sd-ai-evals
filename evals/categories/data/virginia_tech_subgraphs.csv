Also, I think global warming and getting less and less precipitation over time is another cause for this issue. I think feeding this lake from another water resources instead of draining its water may solve the problem temporarily!"

This created an increase in the rate the lake dried up, which creates a decrease in microorganisms. Also, deforestation creates a significant decrease in the annual animal migrating population. The main solution to this issue is to allow Lake Urmia's main water feeder to exclusively flow back into to lake to prevent any future lake evaporation. In addition, discontinuing any future dam construction and water transfer projects can contribute to an increase in the life of the lake."

The destruction of the lake was from 1972 to 2014, not ""recent years"". Rapid growth and mismanagement have cascaded against the life of the lake. It seems like government officials didn't consider the long-term effects of their actions. The $5 million to save the lake is probably a good start, but that's too vague. It's a difficult problem because you don't want to channel too much water away from the large cities because other lives are then at risk. Relocating people is certainly not an elegant solution because they didn't put themselves in this unfortunate situation and that also doesn't protect the environment and ecosystem of Lake Urmia. It only secures the lives of the people. They'd have to figure out a way to channel water to the lake, but based on this passage, I don't see how it could be done."

The problems could be partially due to climate changes (e.g. drought) as suggested by officials, but based on the evidence outlined in this passage there is also most likely a significant human-imposed component related to subverting water from the Zarineh River to support the growing population, as well as the reduction of forests covering Zagros Mountain -- forests that helped to maintain the controlled water flow to rivers feeding the lake.  Firstly, policy makers need to be informed of the true cause of the problem.  Studies are needed to provide more conclusive evidence about the human behaviors that truly did or did not contribute to the shrinkage of the lake.  Once scientific evidence is collected and analyzed, it can be shared with the community, and scientists should (hopefully) be able to use the data collected to point to the causes and offer suggestions on specific actions that can be taken to reverse or at least slow the damage.  Tradeoffs will be inevitable and debate may continue, but presenting conclusive scientific evidence is the first step toward coming up with a potential solution to the problem.  Until this step is taken, it just will continue to be a debate between government officials and critics within the community. "

Not only did the population increase in the area causing additional burden on the lake, but also there was an increase in agricultural activities increasing burden further on the water body. That coupled with the fact that it's main feeding source was channeled elsewhere and change in ecological conditions also contributed to the lake's decrease in water content. We need to strike a balance between what the lake can provide and what we can consume. It is clear that we are using up more water than what can be replenished naturally. First we need to ensure the lake the sources that feed the lake is not starved. Which means we need to reduce the burden on Zarineh to feed the lake and the city. We alse need to ensure the forests of Zagros aren't depleted further and check  activities of man such as agriculture and population growth. "

Since the region becomes drier as the amount of water decreases, the total amount of water will continue to deplete as the climate promotes faster evaporation. Since the population has increased over the years, the demand for water has increased. Considering the water into the lake has been redirected to meet the demand, the evaporated water is not being replaced at an adequate rate. Limiting the amount of water drawn from the sources would be a way to see if there is a significant difference in evaporation. Allow the water to flow back into the lake rather than drawing large amounts from the inflow. Destroying dams is likely too extreme and expensive. Pumping water in alone likely won't help since the inflows are restricted, so the new water will gradually evaporate anyway."

I would start by graphing the water levels over time to see if any trends appear and from there, try and correlate those trends with any policy decisions that were made. You could look at surrounding lakes to see if they suffered the same fate. If they did, the cause may be the drought, but if it is just this lake that is drying up, it may be hard to claim the drought is the causal agent. Talk with environmental experts and see if any solutions worked in the past. Lessen the amount of water used by farmers through restrictions, replant areas of the forrest, find other areas to plant food as a positive feedback loop exists where more plants need more water, which leads to a drier climate, which leads to the plants needing more water. This is just one of the loops that needs to be ended. "

These issues include, population growth, less tree cover, more agriculture, use of its water for other purposes, etc. Ultimately, multiple things must be done to fix these problems. Firstly, the mismanagement of water resources must be investigated and dealt with. Secondly, efforts to restore the ecosystem around the lake to its natural state must be enacted (allowing forests to fill back in, etc.). To make these changes lawmakers and charities will need to gather funds and lawmakers specifically will need to address policies currently in place. "

The factors affect the inflow of the water is raining, dam construction and pipe transfer which apparently all of the mentioned factors decreased. Furthermore, the outflow of the lake includes evaporation which increased because of having more drought environment. The situation should be modeled, and different policies should be checked. The number of dams and also the pipelines that use the water for the agricultural purpose should reduce. The possibility of my proposed method depends on the more broader factors. For example, it might be possible that the government should create different jobs for the Urumia local people to convince them to reduce their agricultural activity. Also, the other option is that the government might have to relocate part of the population to save the lake."

I believe that the main contributor is a reduction of water flow into the lake: primary sources of inflow to the body of water are siphoned and/or dammed, and forests that helped route water into lake sources have shrunk. Of course, drought also contributes to lake shrinkage, but I doubt they are truly the primary cause, given the number of similar cases that have been surfacing worldwide due to similar factors. The impact of major factors (forest shrinkage, river damming, and water siphoning) should be assessed, along with a detailed analysis of the cost and impact of taking corrective action (re-planting forests as possible, destroying dams or increasing flow past dams, and altering pumping plans/systems). Actions should then be taken in the order of cost-efficiency and feasibility. Channeling of other rivers into the lake could help, but could also cause a similar slew of problems for whatever water source those rivers had been feeding, so the side effects should also be taken into consideration."

I believe several people might have attempted to fix the Lake but several of the actions were short term instead of long term.

These will result in the shrinkage of water reservoirs in the lake Urmia. The only natural way to restore the lake is to increase the inflow. These can be done by planting trees in Zagros mountains.

Firstly, there's global warming. Global warming has become a bigger and bigger issue over the years and its side effects are showing up in multiple ways, this lake is more than likely one of them. On top of that, the next big issue for problems is the deterrence of a major water supplier. Next we have had an influx of people, construction and changes in agriculture of forestry near the lake over the years. I'm not sure it can be saved at this point. One option is to see if the city can find another water supply that wouldn't cause more adverse damages. I dont think its feasible to relocate families, it is not their fault they were allowed to move there and it in turn affected Lake Urmia.

The lake's evaporation will likely be attributed to climate factors (eg the drought), but it is likely that the human development harmed the lake's ability to withstand those factors. It is likely unrealistic to destroy dams or force people to abandon their homes. Instead, zoning restrictions should be created to prevent further development around the lake, further draining of streams that feed into the lake, and further deforestation of the surrounding area. The government can also add taxes to decentivise activities that harm the lake - such as using water from the streams that feed into the lake or driving over the road that crosses the lake. The tax revenue can also be used to fund conservation efforts, educate local citizens about the lake's value, etc."

For the protection of Lake Urmia Biosphere Reserve, both the Govt. and the residing population has to step in. Following are some ideas that can help save Lake Urmia BR-
1. A dedicated Lake Urmia Biosphere Reserve Protection Board needs to be set-up.
2. Board members should include geographical/geological experts, environmentalists, climatologists, anthropologists, Govt. officials and some members of the local population.
3. A framework needs to be developed for at least the forthcoming half a decade on how to approach this save.
4. Identify the factors which are significantly affecting this reserve & implement restrictions asap to ensure any further damage to the ecosystem.
5. Spreading the word in the region as well the adjoining areas about the importance of this ecosystem through seminars and other present means of mass communication.
6. Broadcasting the examples from around the world where such ecosystems have been preserved by the active human intervention, thereby, projecting optimism and enthusiasm around the region."

The situation of Lake Urmia seems to have multiple layers of context surrounding it, and- compounding the problem even further- this is likely all being impacted by a global environmental context which is even harder to analyze (I'll leave that to the brilliant climate change PhDs, but I do follow some of the research in this space).
But- isolating on the Lake Urma issue, it seems like the ""root"" of the issue are the competing interests. Everybody [people and animals] needs water. Water is life. And there's clearly been some human intervention that has disrupted the ecosystem. But the tricky part is- again- that water is life. It sounds like the folks in the city where the feeder river (to lake Urma) is being rerouted really needed the water. Fresh water supplies in urban areas are a huge area. And yet, rerouting the river to this population may significantly hurt the population in Lake Urma area. How do officials decide who to prioritize? Whose needs to prioritize? (Where who, in this case, also includes all of the non-human living creatures that depend on the lake). Essentially by making these decisions, officials are saying ""you matter"" to one group and ""you don't"" to another. It's not hard then to imagine why folks have emotional responses to this. It's their livelihood, their survival, and also their legacy- many families probably lived at this lake for multiple generations. And yet, there are other legitimate needs for the lake. How does one reconcile these deeply rooted issues? (and here it is worth noting that once folks get emotionally invested, conversations can quickly become more and more polarizing, making it hard to find a ""compromise"" solution. 
Another tricky part of weighing these options, for the officials, is predicting the future [unpredictability of future makes fidning a good policy difficult]. Folks can make best guesses- but even the best trained analyst can't always predict the consequences of their plans. I'd say there is a little bit of that going on in the Lake Urma case too. I think an immediate step is to try to get everyone at the same table. All stakeholders. Otherwise, consequences of any proposed solution moving forward could be overlooked. Doesn't seem like there is going to a perfect solution here- so I think the best hope is to gather folks--all folks whose voices need to be heard in this-- and come up with a solution that is messy and imperfect but also collaborative and forward-looking, considering future implications for actions taken in the present.

On the other hand, an increase in population, deforestation and other factors involving people in the area have resulted in a decline in the lake's water level. First of all, the people in the areas near lake Urmia should be consulted so that they can share their perspectives on what is happening to the lake. Exerts who have already worked on this project need to be consulted to find out what they have already learned form their attempts including the successes and failures of such endeavors. The people living in the area need to be enlightened about the role of human activities in the poor conditions of the lake and their collaboration sought in how to determine and implement potential solutions. These efforts will foster a deeper understanding of the problem and promote a sense of responsibility among the people for finding a solution.

I think these actions, combined with global climate change/drought, have contributed to the lake shrinking. If they have 5 million dollars to spend, maybe they could try to tap into a different water source than the river with a pipeline. Some things like global climate change may be out of the control of the immediate people who would seek to make change in the lake. I would suggest reducing the amount of water being taken from the feeder river but this may not be an option if that is the city's water supply. Likewise, if they reduce agriculture land by replanting trees they may not have enough food (but on the flip side, damaging the lake by deforesting means less water for agriculture too). Maybe the government should invest time/expertise in finding an optimal balance of forest land and agriculture land (to balance water and space for growing) while also looking into alternative water for the city if possible.

On the other hand, the excessive growth in the population has increased their share of food and water. Therefore, answering the need of this population has distrusted the balance in the ecosystem through transforming forest to agricultural lands and constructing dams over the water flow that feeds the Lake. These changes have caused the lake to shrink and the ensuing problems. Eventually, many diseases, unemployment, and poor quality of land in terms of agriculture have increased to the extent that the reinforcing spiral has turned around and run in reverse causing people to leave the area. One policy should be to control the population of the region and provide them with facilities elsewhere. This area can only host a limited number of people based on the available resources.

Specifically here are the following reasons why Urmia is suffering from its problems: 
- Global warming, causing an overall rise of temperature in the area and hence increase in evaporation rates causing water level to dry up quickly.
- Increase in water usage in agriculture, household, etc. from Lake Urmia due to the rise of the population to three times. In addition no measure for water restoration were mentioned, causing the water level to shrink through time. 
- Construction of dams and pipelines without proper planning could have caused disruption in the water level and volume. 
- Construction of a raised road across the lake without proper planning could have also caused disruption in the water system of Lake Urmia.
- The shift of the forests to the agricultural lands [NG: lower have caused an increase in demand for water in the area to maintain the ecosystem, hence the demand for water to maintain the agriculture have also increased. Both long term and short term plans should be implemented to protect Lake Urmia. 
Short term: 
- An expert team should be formed immediately to investigate the problems around Lake Urmia. 
- Find the root causes and prioritize on solving the problems both short term and long term. 
- Find possible routes for channeling water from other river sources. 
- Look into the dam construction zone and destroy the least effective ones if needed. 
- Find other water sources on temporary basis to help the population for agriculture and household. For example- looking into the groundwater availability, pumping water from other river sources, rain water reservoirs, etc. 
Long term: 
- Implementation of dams in proper zones with plans of sustainability. 
- No further implementation of roads across the lake.
- If other water sources are unavailable, relocation of people living around the lake has to be ensured. 
-  Build more trees around the lake area to ensure natural flow of water from river sources to the lake. "

It has been stated that the population  tripled which means the lake must have been exploited more.  Also, as the rivers that fed the lake shrank, the lake also became devoid of water and the water scarcity in the region increased. Thus this cycle continued and the cumulatively resulted in the destruction of the lake. The public should be made aware of the situation and the impact it will have on them. It is not enough to just educate them, but effort should be made to facilitate them to protect the lake. For instance, littering around the lake should be made a punishable offence. Other proposals that need not involve the public should be well thought through, for example, relocation of the population around the lake, if intended to be executed, should be critically analyzed regarding the level to which the lake will be restored and if its worth the effort."
