Similarly, the larger the revenue of the firm, the greater the sales budget.

The dealer monitors sales (perceived sales), and if, for example, they seem to be rising, she adjusts orders to the factory to bring inventory up to her new desired inventory that provides ten days’ coverage at the higher sales rate.

The ordering of new production capacity is a function of delivery delay only.

Negative cognitive representations influence the way in which one attunes to stress stimuli, leading an individual to orient and maintain his/her focus on negative information. Negatively biased attention and processing increases one’s perceived level of stress which leads to negative affect such as sadness and biased interpretations of negative stimuli that often align with one’s negative mental models. The processing of negative thoughts and affect is encoded and stored in one’s memory, further strengthening existing negative cognitive representations. negative affect and interpretations intensify one’s propensity for ruminative thought which further compounds perceptions of stress and increases negative affect.  negative affect and interpretations contribute to dysfunctional behaviors and strengthen negative cognitive models. An example of this is the self perceptions of worthlessness and feelings of guilt one might experience after having shoved his/her partner during a heated argument. The dysfunctional behavior in this example intensifies the perception of oneself as worthless. Increased negative affect inhibits the efficiency of one’s working memory, leading to less optimal cognitive performance. Cognitive performance is weakened by impaired memory and sleep problems and further contributes to dysfunctional behaviors. Dysfunctional behaviors reinforce negative cognitive representations and lead to biased attentional processes, increased perceptions of stress, negative affect and interpretations, and further inhibit the efficiency of  working memory."

The stock of defects is drained by two flows: reactive maintenance (repair of failed equipment) and planned maintenance (proactive repair of operable equipment). As equipment defects accumulate, the chance of a breakdown increases. Breakdowns lead to more reactive maintenance, and after repair, the equipment is returned to service and the stock of equipment defects is reduced. Similarly, scheduled maintenance or equipment monitoring may reveal the presence of latent defects. The equipment is then taken out of service and the defects are corrected before a breakdown occurs. Obviously, breakdowns reduce plant uptime. In addition, most planned maintenance activity also reduce uptime since planned maintenance frequently requires operable equipment be taken out of service so the needed work can be done. Breakdowns cause collateral damage, directly increasing the stock of defects further and leading to still more breakdowns in a vicious cycle. Because the total number of mechanics is limited, more breakdowns necessarily pull mechanics off planned work as management reassigns mechanics to repair work. With less planned work, breakdowns increase still more.  When plan uptime is low, operators are less willing to take working equipment down for planned maintenance. "

An increase in the Firm’s Quality (FQ) leads to an upwards shift in the competitor’s appreciation of FQ, which in turn leads to a desire for the competitor to generate an improvement in its own quality. After an appropriate time lag, representing the internal workings of the company, this desire to improve quality generates an actual improvement in the Competitor’s Quality (CQ). However, as this improvement in CQ is being realised, a similar chain of events is taking place within the firm, which in turn causes an upward movement in FQ. In both cases the desired improvements in quality are considered to be a function of the difference between the firm’s own quality and its appreciation of its competitor’s quality. However, the lag in generating an actual improvement in quality is considered to be a function of the current level of quality. This implies that it becomes increasingly difficult to improve quality as the overall level of quality becomes higher."

A high pending pool means more dissatisfied customers as claimants find themselves waiting longer. Claims processing centers carefully monitor the pending pool, regularly reporting various measures of work flow. An increase in incoming claims causes the pending pool to rise, intensifying the time pressure on each adjuster. Time pressure measures the adequacy of the adjuster staff and skills available to handle the current case load. There are only three ways in which high time pressure can be relieved: devote less time to each claim; increase work intensity; add adjuster capacity. Each option forms a balancing feedback process which seeks to restore time pressure to normal. However, the three channels for controlling the work flow involve very different time delays, costs, and side effects. Adding adjuster capacity means hiring additional adjusters, improving training, and reducing turnover, increasing time available and settlements, reducing the pending pool, and relieving time pressure. But building adjuster capacity takes time. New adjusters must be found, hired, and trained. Adjusting is a highly skilled profession, and the ability to handle complex claims effectively requires years of experience. Building capacity is also expensive and requires top-management authorization. Adding adjuster capacity was therefore the last resort in the organization. Increasing work intensity means longer work weeks, fewer breaks, and less time spent in 'nonproductive' activities such as talking with colleagues or training new hires, increasing the time spent settling claims and draining the pending pool. Overtime is frequently used to control the pending pool. However, sustained high work intensity produces stress, low morale, and burnout, lowering productivity and increasing turnover. By far the easiest and quickest way to control time pressure is to settle each claim faster. Individual adjusters have a high degree of control over the time they spend on a claim. They decide how aggressively to pursue investigation, whether to visit the claimant or handle the claim by 'telephone adjusting', how long to negotiate with the claimant, how much time to spend keeping records. When time pressure rises adjusters cut back on all of these activities, quickly cutting the pending pool and easing time pressure. However, spending less time on each claim inevitably erodes the quality of the settlements. Inadequate attention to documentation means the firm is less successful in litigation and subrogation, increasing settlement costs. Effort is wasted trying to locate and reconstruct evidence improperly recorded at the time of the loss, increasing the time required to settle and further intensifying time pressure in a vicious cycle. Less investigation and negotiation means settlements are likely to be inflated. Settlement costs increase as adjusters under time pressure tend to agree to a claimant's initial request, up to the amount they are authorized to pay without a supervisor's approval."

High profitability attracts producers’ attention to more cultivation. Higher rates of cultivation result in an increased level of orchards, which gives rise to the production, with a considerable delay. Increase in orchards area raises labor and water consumption, contributing to production. Since cultivating young orchards requires vast investments and around more than 5 years is needed to reach the highest yield levels, the associated fixed costs prevent the infinite revenue growth and balance the revenue–cost ratio. Moreover, orchards maintenance and materials used for production, labor compensation, and cost of acquiring water control the revenue growth. To have an economically harvestable yield, producers must irrigate orchards frequently. More orchards increase the need for more water; therefore, pumping from the groundwater, as the primary source of water in the region, surges. Accordingly, if the pumping is higher than the inflow to the ground water, which has been the case over the past decades, the ground water level declines, resulting in less available water. Lower water availability reduces pistachio production. Moreover, as the groundwater level decreases, the cost of acquiring water increases. This includes the cost of drilling, pumping, water-well maintenance, and so on, which hugely affects the profitability of farmers. Water inflow includes precipitation and laterflows to the groundwater."
