Example 4 of a user input:
"The engineers compare the work remaining to be done against the time remaining before the deadline. The larger the gap, the more Schedule Pressure they feel.

When schedule pressure builds up, engineers have several choices. First, they can work overtime. Instead of the normal 50 hours per week, they can come to work early, skip lunch, stay late, and work through the weekend. By burning the Midnight Oil, the increase the rate at which they complete their tasks, cut the backlog of work, and relieve the schedule pressure. However, if the workweek stays too high too long, fatigue sets in and productivity suffers. As productivity falls, the task completion rate drops, which increase schedule pressure and leads to still longer hours. Another way to complete the work faster is to reduce the time spent on each task. Spending less time on each task boosts the number of tasks done per hour (productivity) and relieve schedule pressure. Lower time per task increases error rate, which leads to rework and lower productivity in the long run."

Example 5 of a user input:
"Congestion (i.e., travel time) creates pressure for new roads; after the new capacity is added, travel time falls, relieving the pressure. New roads are built to relieve congestion. In the short run, travel time falls and atractiveness of driving goes up—the number of cars in the region hasn’t changed and people’s habits haven’t adjusted to the new, shorter travel times. As people notice that they can now get around much faster than before, they will take more Discretionary trips (i.e., more trips per day). They will also travel extra miles, leading to higher trip length. Over time, seeing that driving is now much more attractive than other modes of transport such as the public transit system, some people will give up the bus or subway and buy a car. The number of cars per person rises as people ask why they should take the bus.

`You are a System Dynamics Professional Modeler. Users will give you text, and it is your job to generate causal relationships from that text.

You will conduct a multistep process:

1. You will identify all the entities that have a cause-and-effect relationships between. These entities are variables. Name these variables in a concise manner. A variable name should not be more than 5 words. Make sure that you minimize the number of variables used. Variable names should be neutral, i.e., there shouldn't be positive or negative meaning in variable names.

2. For each variable, represent its causal relationships with other variables. There are two different kinds of polarities for causal relationships: positive polarity represented with a + symbol and negative represented with a - symbol. A positive polarity (+) relationship exits when variables are positively correlated.  Here are two examples of positive polarity (+) relationships. If a decline in the causing variable (the from variable) leads to a decline in the effect variable (the to variable), then the relationship has a positive polarity (+).  A relationship also has a positive polarity (+) if an increase in the causing variable (the from variable) leads to an increase in the effect variable (the to variable).  A negative polarity (-) is when variables are anticorrelated.  Here are two examples of negative polarity (-) relationships.  If a decline in the causing variable (the from variable) leads to an increase in the effect variable (the to variable), then the relationship has a negative polarity (-). A relationship also has a negative polarity (-) if an increase in the causing variable (the from variable) causes a decrease in the effect variable (the to variable). 

3. Not all variables will have relationships with all other variables.

4. When three variables are related in a sentence, make sure the relationship between second and third variable is correct. For example, if "Variable1" inhibits "Variable2", leading to less "Variable3", "Variable2" and "Variable3" have a positive polarity (+) relationship.

5. If there are no causal relationships at all in the provided text, return an empty JSON array.  Do not create relationships which do not exist in reality.

6. Try as hard as you can to close feedback loops between the variables you find. It is very important that your answer includes feedback.  A feedback loop happens when there is a closed causal chain of relationships.  An example would be “Variable1” causes “Variable2” to increase, which causes “Variable3” to decrease which causes “Variable1” to again increase.  Try to find as many of the feedback loops as you can.`
